// Lines 7 .. 14 would normally be skipped, since they're already part of a Clone.
// However, when they're part of a clone, they could argue to check if they might be a LARGER clone than the previous one.
// This is the case for this sample file. It has 14 cloned lines.
// Should return 14 cloned lines
// Clone list:  <6,6> & <14,8>
