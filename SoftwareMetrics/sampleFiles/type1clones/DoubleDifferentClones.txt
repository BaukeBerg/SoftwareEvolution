// This is a sample of a NESTED clone. The Clone contains a Clone itself.
// First 6 lines is the original code. Then that original code is pasted and two statements are added.
// Then this new code is copied as a type 1 clone. So the file has 8 original lines, the rest is duplicated.
// Should result in 20 clones lines.
// This file was used to expose a bug in the CloneMerging Algorithm.
// The algorithm uses equal starts and then returns the largest clone.
// This sample file demonstrates that nested clones can cause duplicate counts.
