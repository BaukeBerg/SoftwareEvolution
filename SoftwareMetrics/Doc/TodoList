Minimum:

Type I Clone detection: Exact duplicates
  - Clean up the code => remove unused overloads, logging etc. refactor into proper functions
  
  === Type 1 clone classes are incorrectly detected ===
  - Starting point is the Series 1 Code.
    + Divide into 'Clones / Clone Pairs and Clone Classes' => Slides page 5
    + Log output of the tool somewhere to the visualization (tooltip / clickable?)
  
  === Testing harnass is unconvincing, is limited in scope or not thorough. ===
  - All functions / methods should be based on tests with files / known input, all methods require validation
  
  === Cloning visualization does not give insight or does not work properly ===
  - Visualization in Rascal => One-stop shop
  - At least on a per-file basis
    + Different colours per clone type
    
  === The clone detection report is incomplete or imcompenehsible ===
  - Visualization / perhaps some textual output? ....
  
  === Not able to explain the core algorithm or answer questions about it ====
  === Documentation describres unfounded, unsupported illogical or anecdotal motivation for visualization ===
  === Non-interactive static visualization ===
  === Does not work work on hsqldb ====
